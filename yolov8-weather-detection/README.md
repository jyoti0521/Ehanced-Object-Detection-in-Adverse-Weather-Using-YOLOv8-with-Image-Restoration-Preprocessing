# Enhanced Object Detection in Adverse Weather Using YOLOv8

This project enhances object detection in images affected by snow, fog, or rain using simple preprocessing filters before applying YOLOv8 detection.

## Folders

- `test_images/` - contains sample input images
- `image_restoration/` - contains simple preprocessing methods
- `results/` - stores output image after detection

## Run

```bash
python weather_detection.py
